    <ul><b>
      <li>Fort Bassein, also known as the Vasai Fort or Corte de Baçaim meaning "Court of Bassein" in Indo-Portuguese creole, is a ruined fort in the town of Vasai (Bassein) in the Palghar district of Konkan division in Maharashtra, India. </li> <br>
      <li>The name "Bassein" is the anglicised version of the Portuguese Baçaim (the "ç" pronounced as "s" and with the "m" silent), which is itself a derivation of an apparently native name that may have a connection to the tribal Vasa Konkani people[1] of the North Konkan region, extending from Mumbai (Bombay) into "South Gujarat". Bassein's alternate official name is Vasai.</li> <br>
      <li>The fort is located in the Mangelwada of Kelve village.There is a small Kelve pankot on the mouth of the Kelve creek.</li> <br>
      <li>The full form of the Portuguese name is "Fortaleza de São Sebastião de Baçaím" or the Fort of St. Sebastian of Vasai. The fort is a monument of national importance and is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India</li> <br>
      <li>The fort and the town are accessible via the Vasai Road railway station which itself is in Navghar-Manikpur, a part of the city of Vasai-Virar, and lies to the immediate north of the city of Mumbai and Mira Road in Bhayandar</li> <br>

      <h3>History :</h3><br>
      <li>The Treaty of Vasai (1534) was signed by Sultan Bahadur of Gujarat and the Kingdom of Portugal on 23 December 1534 while on board the galleon São Mateus. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Portuguese Empire gained control of the city of Vasai, as well as its territories, islands, and seas. The Mumbai Islands under Portuguese control include Colaba, Old Woman's Island, Mumbai, Mazagaon, Worli, Matunga, and Mahim. Salsette, Daman and Diu, Thane, Kalyan, and Chaul were other territories controlled and settled by the Portuguese.</li> <br>
      <li>At the time, the cession of Mumbai was of minor importance - but retroactively it gained a crucial importance when the place passed from the Portuguese to the British in 1661 as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza and became a major trade centre - making this the treaty's most important long-term result. Vasai was the Portuguese northern capital at the time of the 16th-century treaty with the Sultan.</li> <br>
      <li>Under Portuguese India, the fort was the Northern Court or "Corte da Norte", second only to the city of Goa, functioning as the headquarters of the Captain of the North. For approximately 150 years, the presence of the Portuguese made the surrounding area a vibrant and opulent city.</li> <br>
      <li>In the 18th century, the Bassein Fort was taken over by the Maratha Empire under Peshwa Baji Rao's brother Chimaji Appa and fell in 1739 after the Battle of Vasai. The fort was taken by British in 1774 and returned to Maratha in 1783 under the Treaty of Salbai. The British in 1818 attacked and again took over the territory from the Marathas. The fort also played a strategic role in the First Anglo-Maratha War</li> <br>
      </div>
      <li>The fort is a major tourist attraction in the region . The ramparts overlook what is alternatively called the Vasai Creek and the Bhayandar Creek and are almost complete, though overgrown by vegetation. Several watch-towers still stand, with safe staircases leading up. The Buildings inside the fort are in ruins, although there are enough standing walls to give a good idea of the floor plans of these structures. Some have well-preserved facades. In particular, many of the arches have weathered the years remarkably well. They are usually decorated with carved stones, some weathered beyond recognition, others still displaying sharp chisel marks</li> <br>
      <li>Three chapels inside the fort are still recognisable. They have facades typical of 17th-century Churches. The southernmost of these has a well-preserved barrel-vaulted ceiling. Besides all the structures, tourists often also observe the nature that has taken over much of the fort. Butterflies, birds, plants and reptiles can all be observed.</li>
